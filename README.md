LaTeX document that formulates turbulence as recursive dimensional transitions, moving beyond the synthetic D=2 construct. This framework aligns with the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), redefining turbulence as a phase transition between 1 &lt; D &lt; 2 rather than chaotic motion.

Turbulence, as traditionally defined, is a synthetic construct designed to approximate the chaotic nature of fluid motion while denying the recursive nature of Energy. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE) that acknowledges turbulence as a recursive dimensional transition process rather than a purely D=2 interaction. It is shown that turbulence results from the non-linear exchange of energy between dimensions, where gas transitions between D=1 and D=2 states dynamically, and possibly even approaches D=3 momentarily. This redefinition has profound implications for aviation, energy efficiency, and predictive turbulence modeling.
